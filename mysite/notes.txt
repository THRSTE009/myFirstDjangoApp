Part 2:

Three NB steps to making models:
1. Change your models in models.py.
2. Run $py manage.py makemigrations to *create* migrations for those changes. I.e. stage commits.
3. Run $py manage.py migrate to *apply* those changes to the db. I.e. push commits.
See below for details.

$py manage.py migrate	-->looks at the INSTALLED_APPS setting and creates any necessary database tables according to the db setting in 	mysite/settings.py and the db migrations shipped with the app.

$py manage.py makemigrations polls	--> You’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models and that you’d like the changes to be stored as a migration.
	Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema) - they’re files on disk. 

$py manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001	-->The sqlmigrate command takes migration names and returns their SQL to the screen so that you can see what SQL Django thinks is required.

$py manage.py check	--> checks for any problems in the project without making migrations or touching the db.

$python manage.py createsuperuser	--> Create an admin user.

$python manage.py runserver		--> Start dev server.
